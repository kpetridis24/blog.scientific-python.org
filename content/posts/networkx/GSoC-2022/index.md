# Intro
I got accepted as a **GSoC** contributor, and I am so excited to spend the summer working on 
such an incredibly interesting project. The mentors are very welcoming, communicative, fun 
to be around, and I really look forward to collaborating with them. My application for GSoC 2022 
can be [found here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/V1hY83XG).

# Project
The project I'll be working on, is the implementation of **VF2++**, a state-of-the-art algorithm used for the 
**Graph Isomorphism** problem.
